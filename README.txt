Simple shell based password generator inspired by the nice dictionary based password generator that was included in macOS/MacOS X before Catalina.

Word list taken from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, modified to remove acronyms and split into separate files by character count.
You can prepare your own word list with the split_wordlist.sh script.

Usage:

pwgen.sh --> generates a list of passwords of the default length. Number of generated PWs and their default length can be configured in the script

pwgen.sh -l <length> --> change length of generated passwords
pwgen.sh -n <number> --> change the number of generated passwords

Sample Output:

Otte72=doors
foge76;raphe
pome*08confr
Ewen(24Candy
foge19-izzat
